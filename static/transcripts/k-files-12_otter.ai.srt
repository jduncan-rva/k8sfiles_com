00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,009
Jamie Duncan: All right, and
thanks for joining us on the

2
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:21,629
first episode of 2021. For the K
files, this is Episode 12.

3
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,360
We had planned to do an episode
in late November, early December

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,570
to round out 2020. And then the
world kind of ended.

5
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,669
And then the world never really
started back up. So we will get

6
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:38,849
back to the CI CD series we
talked about, we just honestly

7
00:00:38,849 --> 00:00:42,959
do not have the bandwidth in our
brains to do that extra work and

8
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:47,309
to be able to deliver any kind
of meaningful thought on it. So

9
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,579
what we talked about earlier,
and we were kind of figuring

10
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,499
out, we knew we wanted to record
something we knew we wanted to

11
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:55,889
get something out there. And the
first thing I think it was out

12
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,809
of I think, john, you're the one
that said it maybe it was you,

13
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,769
Tarik, I don't remember which,
but why is why is it all so damn

14
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:06,359
hard? Like, and that's what
we're gonna kind of try to

15
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,329
explore. And it may take a
couple of different directions.

16
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,359
I think, john, you're thinking
like, why is it so hard to get

17
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,619
started in it? That's kind of
where your brain is. My brain is

18
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,939
more? Why is it so hard to solve
a problem in our industry right

19
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,649
now? Why does everything take
400 extra things when it didn't

20
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:27,719
feel like it used to do that?
torque?

21
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,020
Tariq Islam: Yeah, I love the
same mind to do Jamie, I am at a

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,020
point now where it's like, I
can't even Hello World Without

23
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,650
googling eight things. And
there's just no getting away

24
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,410
from that now, every time I
think john, you put it best,

25
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,570
every time you sit down at your
computer, it's like you have to,

26
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,910
you're starting a whole project
from scratch, and it's gonna

27
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,020
take you eight years to,

28
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,790
John Osborne: to get anywhere.
It is I mean, it's the, I think

29
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,120
that trend has been, you know,
where thing is getting harder

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,490
and maybe optimizing for, you
know, really use cases that

31
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,730
aren't in the now has been
happening for a while. But then

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,960
with 2020, for me, personally,
you know, I was just kind of

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,580
like, wiped out emotionally all
year. And the time I had to work

34
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,570
was in was just not as much that
as the year before. And so, you

35
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,510
know, sometimes, you know, I'd
be doing meetings and other

36
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,950
stuff, and you know, non coding
and non, you know, real hands on

37
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,100
keyboard stuff. And then, you
know, I'd sit down after like

38
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,860
two or three weeks, I'm not
doing anything. And, you know, I

39
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,130
have a lot of experience, but it
was like starting over. You know

40
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,080
what I mean? Because it's like,
none of that stuff's in short

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,530
term memory, it would take so
long to get back to where you

42
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,070
were. And it, I spent a lot of
time just thinking about, you

43
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,100
know, I think some of us were,
we're lucky that we had a

44
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,490
fundamental baseline knowledge
of things. And we saw things

45
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,760
like, you know, Kubernetes, and
serverless, and all these types

46
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,850
of things that are in the know
now, but I think if you're

47
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,310
starting now, it's, it's
actually really hard because you

48
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,310
don't have, you know, deep
learning experience or

49
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,740
understands, like, deep
networking, or how, like, the

50
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,870
software defined network just
kind of makes sense to you and

51
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,530
those types of things. And so,
you know, it's like, where

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,220
people ask me, like, how should
I get started, and I try not to

53
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,290
be too prescriptive, because
everyone learns differently.

54
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,070
But, you know, I do have some,
some thoughts on it still,

55
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:21,389
Tariq Islam: I'm gonna, I'm
gonna call out also parents,

56
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,069
right? I mean, during COVID, we
got we got knocked around really

57
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:30,689
hard, all year long, and we
still kind of are, and the

58
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:34,679
exhaustion between the
navigating the pandemic, and

59
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:39,869
work, and the kids. And just
things happening, you know, by

60
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:42,389
the time you sit down, and
you're like, you know, what,

61
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:46,469
today's the day that I'm finally
going to learn go, right, right,

62
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:49,289
right. And it just, it just, you
just don't have the energy for

63
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:51,419
it. And then you get that
anxiety and then you run out of

64
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:54,449
time, because you know, you got
a kid screaming, or you can,

65
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,269
something else has come up,
that's higher priority than

66
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,669
learning a language that you
probably won't end up using on a

67
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:01,379
regular basis tomorrow.

68
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,260
John Osborne: I mean, I had so
much anxiety, like we're also

69
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,660
building this house way over
budget, like, you know,

70
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,630
financial stuff, and like, I had
so much anxiety for a lot of

71
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,040
2020 that I would go 90 days
without returning somebody text

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,560
messages like people wish me
happy birthday in August. I

73
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,500
replied in like, November,
December, and then I got so much

74
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,230
anxiety because one day I just
like had a cup of coffee and I'm

75
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,820
like a reply though. And then
they started replying right

76
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,490
away, like I replied, You know,
it took me nine days to reply,

77
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,630
they replied right away, and
then

78
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,430
they replied right away. That
was john. And then and then I

79
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,220
just replied to those their text
messages like last week. And so

80
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,830
it's like, if I can't even reply
to a text message from a friend

81
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,790
like how am I supposed to sit?

82
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,510
There do all this stuff, but
it's like, you know, it's just

83
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,530
been crazy.

84
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,080
Jamie Duncan: Yeah, there's got
to be something to that because

85
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,580
I kind of live my life in a in a
state of interrupt.

86
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,820
John Osborne: You really do. I'm
actually floored with how, like

87
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,210
you can context switch so
easily, Jamie, that it's kind

88
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,310
Jamie Duncan: of right. I do it
constantly, right. So it's

89
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,160
purely a learning Skill because
I have no attention span

90
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,060
whatsoever. And I used to think
I had this amazing ability to

91
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,840
focus. And when I got a little
self awareness, I realized I

92
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,620
wasn't focusing at all. I was
just spinning 50 plates at once.

93
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:19,050
Yeah. And so I always thought
that kind of burnout. I wasn't

94
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,510
burnout proof, no one's burnout
proof, but I thought I was more

95
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,500
resistant to it than other
people. And I felt it. And I

96
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,170
think that, and I've kind of
built in my own head, the thing

97
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,910
that I value my own skill, is it
if if it's just if the thing

98
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,080
between me and doing something
well is hard work, I feel okay.

99
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,420
That 100 we're sitting down to
knock it out, I'm good. If I've

100
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,260
got to outwork somebody, I've
got that in the back. Man the

101
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,270
past few months, like more times
than I want to admit freely, I

102
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,670
would be sitting at my desk and
realize I was staring at the

103
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,850
same screen for 10 minutes. And
then the only thought in my head

104
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,920
was go lay on the couch in the
other room.

105
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,260
John Osborne: Oh, yeah. I mean,
like, we're just

106
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:10,710
Jamie Duncan: like the work like
it's oppressive. And I don't

107
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,160
know how much of that is just
sort of, I don't I don't know

108
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,800
how much of the Why is
everything so damn hard, is

109
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,500
because the world we're living
in is essentially a wood

110
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:19,980
chipper.

111
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,620
John Osborne: I think it's
they're related. I mean,

112
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,490
everything has been getting
harder. But the emotional energy

113
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:32,160
that you have to do it all.
Again, we're just not there. I

114
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,070
mean, there were times Yeah,
we're not like, you know, I have

115
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,980
to be on video a lot, too. So
and I'm introverted. So you

116
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,140
know, two hours being on video
talking a lot. Like, yeah, I'd

117
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,260
have to lay down after the
middle, you know, like,

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,500
Jamie Duncan: lay down, you mean
fetal position. And

119
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,280
John Osborne: then I'm gonna go,
you know, cry in the shower

120
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:50,700
floor.

121
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,420
Jamie Duncan: I was actually so
I had lunch with a friend, a

122
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,830
good friend of mine, like, we
worked together for years. And

123
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,250
so we're sitting, you know,
we're doing the whole social

124
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,350
distancing. But we hadn't seen
each other in months. And we

125
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:09,060
were kind of in she was in the
bubble. pretty consistently. So

126
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,520
like, we're like, we've shared
enough germs that we're kind of

127
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,110
in the same in the same bubble.
And we hadn't seen her since God

128
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,120
before Thanksgiving. So we had
lunch yesterday. And she's like,

129
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,180
How are y'all doing? Like, how's
the family and the only thing I

130
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,770
could express to her was, I
don't have any capacity left.

131
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,210
Like, I'm just empty. And but
the list of things on my to do

132
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:44,160
list is not empty. It's not
going down. And part of it is

133
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,450
that the industry has gotten so
nuts and I don't know another

134
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,570
word to put to it. Yeah. But it
was like, it's,

135
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,720
Tariq Islam: there's this. I
think I might have a term for

136
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,110
it. It's

137
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,450
it. There's, it's like a
fetishization of abstraction. I

138
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:06,180
feel like, I'm going to put it I
maybe that's not the right term,

139
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,410
but I feel like that's the right
term. It's just everything. And

140
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,630
I think that's why I end up
having to, like, if I want to do

141
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,280
hello world, you know, 15 years
ago, 10 years ago, take you like

142
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,300
45 seconds, right? Sit down, do
it knock it out. Now. It's like

143
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,290
frameworks on frameworks on
abstractions, and just doesn't,

144
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,920
I'm in the trap. Yeah, exactly.
Like someone that personality

145
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,200
has been around for a long time,
though. Cuz I remember, the

146
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,960
first time I actually got my
first job out of college, I just

147
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,540
wrote c++ and didn't talk to
anyone, which I, which I didn't

148
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,280
like, at the time, but now I'd
be like, Oh, that's amazing job

149
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,450
dream job, like.

150
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,810
John Osborne: But the first time
I actually looked at somebody

151
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,070
else's code, as part as a full
time coder, was like, there's it

152
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,620
was Java code. And there was
like, eight levels of

153
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,890
abstraction and like clicking
this abstract classes interface,

154
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,650
and you got to actually see what
the find like three lines of

155
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,220
code. And I do feel like there's
a personality in tech that just

156
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,630
likes that, like, it's a very,
quote unquote, clean to them.

157
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,750
Tariq Islam: If that makes
sense, that that abstraction,

158
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,350
that abstraction, you know, when
you I mean, that, that that

159
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,670
object oriented, Java
abstraction, right, the the

160
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,860
interfaces and the
implementations and the

161
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,150
templating. And all that. That's
when that's when I feel like, at

162
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,940
least for me, I was like this,
someone's gonna over engineer

163
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,360
the hell out of something using
this. And lo and behold, you

164
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,880
know, now we're here and
everything feels over

165
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,670
engineered. Everything's got to
be an abstracted framework.

166
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,840
Everything's got to be, you
know, some sort of standard. So

167
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,240
I feel for folks that are
entering into the industry. I

168
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,970
mean, I see folks on Twitter
that are, you know, starting

169
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,600
their journey in tech as a
developer. You see, Jamie

170
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,760
mentioned 100 days of code.
It's, it feels I feel exhausted

171
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,420
for them.

172
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,440
Jamie Duncan: Yeah, now that's
legit. So I mean, I'm doing a

173
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,250
writing project.

174
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,770
John Osborne: Great, john, every
aspects gotten harder. I mean,

175
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,410
if you look at front end
developers Even or something

176
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,330
like that, where it's like
before, you could just write

177
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,350
some JavaScript and, you know,
now it's like, it just feels so

178
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,760
much more, more complicated.
Even doing web development, you

179
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,490
know, this, in front end
development can get super

180
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,240
complicated. Especially if you
start doing things like some of

181
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,210
the advanced html5 elements and
things like that, I actually

182
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,130
think it can get more
complicated than the back end

183
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,650
development, because there's
like, the artistic side to it.

184
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,130
Tariq Islam: Part of it is also,
you know, I guess back in the

185
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,620
day, I don't want I hate saying
that, because it makes me feel a

186
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,530
little old. But back in the day,
you know, you only had so many

187
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,510
languages and frameworks to
choose from, like, for me, it

188
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:45,780
was basically c++, Java, jQuery,
CSS, PHP, go right or not go not

189
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,690
actually, like, take those and
run with it, right. And

190
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,060
everything was built off of
that, and it was great. And you

191
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,220
learn all the concepts and
picking up new languages is not

192
00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:00,690
that big of a deal. You know,
but now it's, it's, I feel like

193
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,040
I could I could pick up a
language Yes, but it what's

194
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,650
gonna, is it gonna be relevant
in two weeks?

195
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,880
John Osborne: Before I feel like
languages the difference, what,

196
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,130
like 15 years ago, the
difference in languages was

197
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,720
largely syntax. And now it's
different fundamental ways of

198
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,740
thinking, if you think about
functional programming, versus

199
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,450
like rust versus go and there's
a lot of, it's more than it's a

200
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,150
lot more than syntax. Now, you
actually have to retrain your

201
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,900
brain. In some cases, languages
went from being general purpose

202
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,220
to specialized in a way, but but
there's but people still try to

203
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,560
use them from purpose languages.
Oh, yeah.

204
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,820
Tariq Islam: Use go for
everything.

205
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:46,769
Jamie Duncan: One of the things,
of course, duh. I mean, this is

206
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:50,969
a Kubernetes. podcast, that has
to be the answer. So there, I'm

207
00:11:50,969 --> 00:11:55,229
working on a little writing
project for for a thing. And

208
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,409
part of like, the little
introduction chapter, or

209
00:11:58,859 --> 00:12:01,889
paragraph is a little bit of a
history lesson. And I was

210
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:05,039
looking up some dates earlier
today. And it really kind of

211
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,809
blew me away because I'm
thinking about them in the

212
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:11,639
context of this. We're on this
runaway train. Things are

213
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:18,299
getting harder, exponentially.
And when did that start? And I

214
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:21,449
don't know when it certainly
didn't start with Kubernetes.

215
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,359
But it certainly didn't start
with Docker. It didn't start

216
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:30,029
with whatever. But just to kind
of put it in context. openshift

217
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:33,119
to Dotto, so we all we were all
at Red Hat at the time.

218
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:41,189
openshift to Dotto was December
2013. So that was just over

219
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:47,009
seven years ago. And that feels
like at least 47 years ago. It

220
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:47,729
really does.

221
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,180
John Osborne: I mean, I can show
you a picture of me for 2013 20

222
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,420
years.

223
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,900
Tariq Islam: I mean, to be fair,
though, to be fair, the last

224
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,270
year feels like it was 40 years
ago.

225
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:02,099
Jamie Duncan: I know it but I
get that. I thought that but

226
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:05,099
then I was like So look, I had
to look up some other dates.

227
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,049
Kubernetes one Dotto was only a
year and a half after that.

228
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:15,089
Yeah, there was only 18 months

229
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,780
John Osborne: before filling
every year, yeah, celery gets

230
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,270
Jamie Duncan: gray and gray. So
we've been on this train for a

231
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:27,000
long time, and then it ran into
2020. And we all fit in a wood

232
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,030
chipper is the only thing the
only analogy I can draw.

233
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,580
John Osborne: You know, part of
the issue is the the technology

234
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,840
is iterating. So much faster
than where most organizations

235
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,740
are now, that every year that
gap gets greater and greater.

236
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,820
And so every year, it just feels
like I mean, if you look at the

237
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,280
technologies that you know, what
is supposed to be like the

238
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,190
simplest way to get up and
running, you might think that

239
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:58,200
might be you know, a managed
serverless instance, right? But

240
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,480
then you go look at it, and it's
like, Okay, well, I need more

241
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,250
than just the serverless
framework, you know, I gotta

242
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,280
connect it to an API gateway.
And then I gotta get a web

243
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,430
application firewall, and then I
got to learn how the, you know,

244
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,280
kinesis is gonna work. And then
you need a cache and an object

245
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,410
store before you know what
you've learned via service

246
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,830
meshes. Yeah. Before you know
what you've learned, 10

247
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,310
different. Your API gateway.
Yeah, get out, you know, to get

248
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,950
like a web app going. And never
mind the fact that you got to,

249
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,780
you know, learn all this stuff.
You have that.

250
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,720
Tariq Islam: So, so I think I
think there's two there's two

251
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,880
things to this. So when when I
first went when I guess all of

252
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,590
us right when we first learned
Kubernetes It was like, what's a

253
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,260
pod was a service was a
deployment, right? Then there

254
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,260
was the openshift specific stuff
back then anyway, right, the

255
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,840
build config and you know, image
stream and things like that.

256
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:52,260
That was like 80% of it. Now,
five and a half years later, I

257
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,840
mean, it's a it's a freaking me.
Yeah, I mean, in fact, in fact,

258
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,050
there are folks there are folks
out there learning You know,

259
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,680
Kubernetes at layers of
abstraction, where they're not

260
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,320
even considering things like
learning what an actual

261
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,720
Kubernetes service is, or does
or what the different types of

262
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,240
services there might be, they're
just clicking buttons and

263
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,100
learning Kubernetes, you know,
at the managed layer, where

264
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,130
Yeah, I've touched Kubernetes
before I've installed and spun

265
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:24,510
up and used Kubernetes. But if
you'd ask them, what a, a, you

266
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,810
know, what the different types
of a service are in Kubernetes,

267
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,720
they probably wouldn't be able
to tell you. And and I don't,

268
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,360
I'm not saying that that's
wrong, or that these individuals

269
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,990
know less. Because, you know,
they don't have to no more than

270
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:42,840
that, necessarily. But it's a
huge gap. And I would argue that

271
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,470
you still do need to know that
underlying stuff. But I don't

272
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,890
think that I just don't think
that people have the energy for

273
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,940
that I put together a there are
some, there's some folks that,

274
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,450
you know, we've we've hired, and
they're aspiring to specialize

275
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,230
in the Kubernetes ecosystem. So
I put together this, this

276
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,140
curriculum of sorts, and this is
maybe about a year and a half

277
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:09,180
ago, year and a half ago. And I
kind of went through, you know,

278
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,210
everything that you need to
know, in the community, or from

279
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,540
a community perspective, right,
the big, you know, major tools

280
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,670
and technologies that you should
be aware of, and that you should

281
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,520
be able to talk to, and then
from a product perspective,

282
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,390
right from from, you know,
Google the vendor. And this

283
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,390
document was like five pages
long. And I'm looking at that,

284
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,690
and I'm like, How did this
happen? And this was 18 months

285
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,570
ago. So I if I had to redo that
Doc, I probably have to be

286
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,970
adding another couple of pages.
It's it's not.

287
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,160
Jamie Duncan: So I wonder. So it
was somewhat one of the people

288
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,250
Clark and I work with rich
Schroeder is one of the project

289
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,990
managers for for Google in the
in Google Cloud. He had a tweet

290
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,140
and I was looking for and I
couldn't find it. But he was

291
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,350
talking about some new thing.
Oh, I think it was about like

292
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:01,620
the some low code product that
Google is, is is has released.

293
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,240
And my response to it, because
it's a pretty compelling thing

294
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,570
for like, I think the tweet, he
had had some statistics, like,

295
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,830
in 2019, X percent of
applications were low code, no

296
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:17,460
code, and that number is going
up into the right, and all that

297
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:23,130
kind of thing. And my response
to him was that we abstract away

298
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:28,050
the things that don't provide
business value. And my thought

299
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,740
at the time was, eventually
virtual machines stopped

300
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,610
providing business value, and we
abstracted them. And we've tried

301
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,550
that a couple of different ways.
And then containers are stopped

302
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,490
are not really the business
value, like getting to the

303
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,490
container, the cost savings of
running Kubernetes running

304
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,270
containerized apps, isn't there
anymore, because it's everyone's

305
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,170
doing it, so no one's doing it
better. So we're abstracting The

306
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,550
next thing? Is that kind of
where is that where your head

307
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,310
is? Tarik? Is that what you're
thinking? Or? Because in to me

308
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,830
that that kind of makes it a
little valid? Because I'm trying

309
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,370
to think, is this good or bad?
Are we building a house of

310
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,160
cards? Or is just the Tower of
Babel getting taller?

311
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,100
Tariq Islam: I think it's the
latter. But at the same time,

312
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,060
it's still technology, right To
this day, you know, however many

313
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:20,520
years we've we've had Linux,
right? It's always the network.

314
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:25,710
It's always DNS, it always comes
back to the fundamentals. And I

315
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,430
think the risk is that, with
this sprawl that we're

316
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:34,230
experiencing, and the sheer
velocity and the acceleration of

317
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,580
of this tech proliferation, I
guess we can call it, it's gonna

318
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,930
get harder and harder for folks
to not just keep up. But even to

319
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,870
start, right. And I think what's
going to have to happen is folks

320
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,230
are going to have to start from
an abstracted level, and then

321
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:54,840
work their way down on a case by
case basis, which is not ideal.

322
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,200
But

323
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,389
John Osborne: if someone asks
you how to get started, what do

324
00:18:57,389 --> 00:18:59,609
you normally kind of advice that
you give them? Because for me,

325
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:05,099
personally, the way I learned is
to build apps, or to build

326
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:08,459
things that, like I want to
build and kind of learn by

327
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:11,879
doing, but I can't, like I can't
just sit down and read, if I

328
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:13,739
have all the fundamental
framework. Yeah, I can read the

329
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:16,289
docs and things will click but
like, if I'm starting up from

330
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,959
scratch, like I don't even read
the docs until after I start

331
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,489
using it because nothing will
click.

332
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,920
Tariq Islam: So interestingly
enough, I'm actually I'm

333
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,820
actually doing this with a with
a couple of folks. Again, these

334
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,600
are the same individuals that
that are brand new to the space.

335
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,590
So it's really interesting to
see how they're taking all of

336
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:41,550
this up. And it's gonna take at
least a year to two for them to

337
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,660
get caught up. But I actually
had them start with getting a

338
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,110
solid understanding of what
makes up a container. Like I had

339
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,290
them start at that level. Right?
And I told them, don't touch

340
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,160
Kubernetes. Don't touch any of
the products right at the vendor

341
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,190
level. Don't even think about
that stuff. Just get good with

342
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,030
containers. Linux and Linux
networking like it, you know,

343
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,820
get those fundamentals down,
because as soon as you do that

344
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,930
everything else just gets easier
from there, it just flows right?

345
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:14,550
It'll take longer. But once you
have that foundation, and I

346
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,650
think that's what's so critical
about this, right, I feel like

347
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,310
folks are starting at a at an at
an abstracted level, that's not

348
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,300
giving them a proper foundation.
For example, if I'm, if I'm

349
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,940
billing myself as a Kubernetes,
expert, and I've only ever

350
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,380
touched, you know, Eks, and aka
s, and G, ke, and all these, you

351
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,160
know, automated offerings, I
might be good at all of these

352
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,370
automated offerings. But as soon
as I'm asked about, you know,

353
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:44,400
something lower than that, I get
hung up. So that's, I think, you

354
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,700
know, it's, it's, it's a point
of exposure that I think folks

355
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,710
are, it's the blind spot,
actually,

356
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,349
Jamie Duncan: I guess that's
what put it, at least in my

357
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:55,139
personal experience, I've always
found it easier to go up the

358
00:20:55,139 --> 00:21:01,679
stack as opposed to down the
stack. Are we? Do you all agree

359
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,649
with that, or the percentage so
like, we're gonna have a whole

360
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:06,839
lot of people that have to go
down the stack, we're gonna have

361
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:11,039
to figure out how to account for
that. Being, you know, the

362
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,959
older, current, get off my lawn
generation, in our industry.

363
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,060
Tariq Islam: Yeah, I don't I
don't mean to gatekeepers here.

364
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,400
That's not I hope that's not the
tone that we're taking, you

365
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,100
John Osborne: know, trying to be
the opposite. It's like, how do

366
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,420
we make it more?

367
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,060
Jamie Duncan: How do we make how
do we make that consumable?

368
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,320
consumable? Yeah.

369
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,590
Tariq Islam: I think the culture
has to change, right? Like, I

370
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,920
think I think we have to
promote, we have to start as a

371
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,340
tech industry, tech Twitter,
right, like social media, I

372
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,750
think we have to start promoting
the this notion that it's okay

373
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,320
to start from the bottom and to
go slow, right there. This is

374
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,130
not a race. And, and having a
good foundation from the basics.

375
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,550
And the fundamentals is only
going to make everything else

376
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,400
that much easier, you'll
accelerate and your velocity

377
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,670
will get to a point where it
matches everybody else's. Right.

378
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,670
But you got to spend the time
and get get get those

379
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,430
fundamentals down. And I think
we have to promote that type of

380
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,510
thing and reward it.

381
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,510
Jamie Duncan: I don't know. I
don't, I don't know that I'm

382
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,610
100% there. And the reason Are
those the reason that I'm not

383
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:19,350
sure there is are those 100 100
days of code people there is

384
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:25,200
there is in this massive influx
of people making 725 an hour who

385
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,220
are going through some Bootcamp,
they saved up for self driving

386
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,790
through some program, like 100
days of code. And they're

387
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:38,400
looking at 6070 $80,000 a year
Junior, whatever jobs, I don't

388
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,550
want to slow them down. I don't
want to tell them to take it

389
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,280
slow, because $7 an hour sucks.

390
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,800
John Osborne: That's a whole
there's a whole slew of people

391
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,120
out there, which I found myself
on this kind of subgroup of

392
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,450
Twitter, where and I think it's
awesome, by the way, but they

393
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,130
they basically use
certifications to you know, pump

394
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,620
up their salary. I would and I
think that's awesome, by the

395
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,430
way. And I do think we did the
certifications episode. You

396
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:10,680
know, I do think it does provide
a good baseline knowledge. But

397
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,140
yeah, they're out there. And,
you know, they're getting all

398
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,670
these certifications, and
they're getting really high paid

399
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,180
jobs, and which is awesome. But
then how do we take every little

400
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,500
practical experience? Yeah,

401
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,130
Jamie Duncan: I found that
experience. And the other

402
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,220
thought that popped into my head
was, and it stuck in my head. I

403
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,730
mean, this is I guess, a year or
so ago, was talking Duffy

404
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,260
Cooley, who is Oji Kubernetes.
awesome guy. I worked with him

405
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,720
at VMware. I think he's he's
moved on to a different role.

406
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:45,510
Now. He's, yeah. He was talking
about how we're we being the

407
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:51,720
Royal we in industry, in it are
massively outnumbered. And he

408
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,420
had some numbers. And I wish I
remembered the numbers. But my

409
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:58,140
brain doesn't do that. Talking
about like, the number of

410
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,840
applications, the number of
servers, the number of thing

411
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:06,000
widgets in it over the next five
years, and how we would, at the

412
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,970
current rate of growth of the it
workforce, we'd all be

413
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:14,400
responsible personally, for like
50,000 servers. We're gonna be

414
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,670
drastically outnumbered for what
the world is doing and the world

415
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,730
the fact that the world is
becoming this IoT platform.

416
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,410
Yeah. So we have to get these
people in, we have to figure out

417
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:31,890
how to get them up to speed. And
I think maybe part of it is that

418
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,710
maybe we make specialization a
little bit more. Okay.

419
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,940
John Osborne: I think it has to
be because if you look at like

420
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,760
even managed services, right,
like if you use a managed

421
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,270
database, that doesn't, that
helps you have less people on

422
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:49,500
your team that need to know,
deep database level knowledge,

423
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,940
but still to do all the backups,
the synchronization, the what

424
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,490
happens when a production outage
happens, like you still need to

425
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,250
have some people that go really
deep into databases, right?

426
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,240
Inside rant I actually the more
I thought about it, I think this

427
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:09,360
kind of this sprawl of
technologies actually happen

428
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,020
first at the data layer, not at
the application layer. Because

429
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,740
if you think about how fast we
went from just using SQL

430
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,600
databases to all the different,
no SQL databases, to all the

431
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,260
things with caching and
invalidation to brokers, and

432
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:30,540
queues, and Kafka, and all that
stuff, and how fast that layer

433
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,080
happened, that actually, to me
happened first, and everyone

434
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,360
knows what CAP theorem is now
and things like that, where it's

435
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,350
like, okay, that's a problem
that we didn't have to that got

436
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,810
a lot harder, a lot faster, just
kind of a specialization of the

437
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:46,890
data layer. But that did happen
because of scale issues. I think

438
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,130
that part of the challenge is
like, well, not everyone's

439
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,330
having a scale issue, right.

440
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,450
Jamie Duncan: Yeah. So and then
I guess, to top it all off, you

441
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:01,380
know, not only are all of those
things happening, they're

442
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:06,870
happening in an ever increasing
rate. And at least in the US,

443
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,140
but we're certainly not the only
group suffering from this.

444
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,050
Society is, you know, in a
horrible state right now, in a

445
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:23,760
lot of places. Like, like, I'm
just sort of, I don't want to be

446
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,180
a Debbie Downer, but man, kind
of a crap way to be right now.

447
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,090
John Osborne: It is because they
don't have the emotional energy.

448
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,130
I mean, it's like somebody who's
got shot in the street, and I'm

449
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,130
supposed to sit down. And you
know what I mean? Like, yeah,

450
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,680
deep. And I was like, I can't
I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

451
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:38,700
Yeah,

452
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,980
Tariq Islam: well, I was I was
having a very productive day on

453
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,240
January 6, up until the coup,
and right at that point, that's

454
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,410
when I realized what was
actually happening. I just kind

455
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,290
of stopped working. And it
wasn't even like a conscious

456
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,930
decision, right? Where I was
like, Okay, I'm going to cancel

457
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,120
all meetings, and I'm not going
to do anything at work, I'm

458
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,150
taking the rest of the day off,
it was literally like, it's

459
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:06,600
like, my, my brain just stopped.
Right. And I just, I was combing

460
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,350
through social media, looking
for whatever coverage I could

461
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:14,160
find, and looking at the
pictures and the videos and the

462
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,180
the sheer pandemonium of it all.
I was just in desperate state of

463
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:23,610
disbelief. And I couldn't, I
completely forgot about work.

464
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,420
And I was like, mid, like, in
the middle of typing an email

465
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,590
when when this all went down.
And I, you know, I got to a

466
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,710
point Finally, where, you know,
I told I told folks, you know,

467
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,280
please, please do what you got
to do for, for your safety and

468
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,600
for your mental health. But, uh,
man, there was a couple of

469
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,200
hours, there was just a total
total pause. There was somebody

470
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,020
John Osborne: in that there was
somebody at the Capitol yelling

471
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:55,620
Turn on the gas. I mean, how am
I supposed to work? during that?

472
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,060
How am I supposed to work?
People getting shot? How am I

473
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,610
supposed to work when there's
people on Reddit even

474
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:04,140
bankrupting a $10 billion hedge
fund? Right? It's been really

475
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,870
hard. It's like, it's,

476
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,940
Tariq Islam: we'll see that
thing, things, things. I mean,

477
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,430
this is a really good mirror of
what's been happening in tech.

478
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,800
Not that tech, is that tragic,
but what I'm saying is that

479
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,170
there's so many things
happening, you know, our memory

480
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:20,790
is only so long. And January 6,
feels like half of an eternity

481
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:24,390
ago. And we don't even we're not
even, we're barely talking about

482
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,780
it. Now. Right now, we're
talking about GameStop. And, you

483
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,450
know, market manipulation by
retail investors, and is that

484
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,510
even mid relation, and they're
sticking it to the man, you

485
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,300
know, the hedge fund managers
and things like that.

486
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,370
Jamie Duncan: But also
weaponizing, Wall Street.

487
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:42,000
Tariq Islam: Right? Right. And
three weeks ago, we literally

488
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,520
had a coup of our government.

489
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,150
John Osborne: So we have no
emotional energy, we sit down,

490
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,730
and technology's a billion times
harder than it was five years.

491
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:51,630
Yeah,

492
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,120
Tariq Islam: I think I think the
theme that we're all getting at

493
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,490
here is, I think we just need to
just, I think we need to slow

494
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:04,440
things down just a bit for
ourselves. You know, I don't

495
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,990
think we can slow down the pace
of everything outside of us. But

496
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:11,940
I think we have to, I think we
have to make it make it okay, to

497
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,430
go a little bit slower. And
actually, Jamie, I like that,

498
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:18,300
you fact that the fact that you
brought up the fact that you

499
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,550
brought up about individuals
that you know, are getting into

500
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,550
this space, and don't have that
luxury of time, right, I feel

501
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,220
like you know, a lot of what
I've said is from a place of

502
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,000
privilege. And for folks that
have that sense of financial

503
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,710
urgency, absolutely, you know,
do what you have to do. And when

504
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:39,150
you get there and you will
absolutely get there. I still

505
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,610
think it's important that you do
take some time once you're in

506
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:45,990
the door to go back and and get
down to those fundamentals.

507
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,740
Right. I think everyone owes it
to owes it to themselves to do

508
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,100
that at some point, maybe not at
the very beginning. But at some

509
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,460
point.

510
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,480
John Osborne: I think it's a
really good point about you

511
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,480
know, it's okay to go slow
because everyone's got Slower

512
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,240
right now. And if somebody calls
you and expects you to go the

513
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,510
same speed, which that's
happened to me a couple times in

514
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,330
past year, it's like, I feel
like those people are just bots,

515
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:13,710
honestly. It's like, it's like,
do you realize what's going on?

516
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,450
You know, have some, you know,
show some emotion. Talk, I

517
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,970
Jamie Duncan: love the idea of
telling people to slow down and

518
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,920
catch their breath and do what
they need to do to be okay. How?

519
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,490
Like, none of this other stuff.
None of these other buzz saws

520
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,590
that are flying in our head are
slowing down

521
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,430
Tariq Islam: in the back to back
meetings every day, certainly

522
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,130
aren't helping, because now we
don't have to, you know, travel

523
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,330
to a meeting or even change
meeting rooms. Right? It's

524
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:45,630
literally just clicking a button
to end one call. And then five

525
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,400
and a half seconds later joining
the next one.

526
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,230
John Osborne: I've been like,
it's okay for me not to answer

527
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,740
the call. Like, just because I'm
not another call doesn't mean

528
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,600
I'm going to answer everybody
that just calls me out of the

529
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,680
blue, or I'm not going to text
back people every right away and

530
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,250
all that stuff, because, or else
I just sit here and just do

531
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,980
notifications on my phone for
all day, which I totally could

532
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,260
do, because that's just how
things go right now.

533
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,320
Jamie Duncan: I aspire to say no
more often.

534
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,760
John Osborne: But how to play
more the long game? No.

535
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,720
Jamie Duncan: Yeah, so so we
have to figure out how to slow

536
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,030
down I our industry is moving at
a pace that is approaching, you

537
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:31,560
know, approaching the speed of
light. The world is falling is

538
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,830
ripping apart at the seams. We
all need to catch our breath.

539
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,510
And I think I don't think
there's like I know that sounds

540
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,210
simplistic, but I don't think
there's anything else we can do.

541
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,090
Tariq Islam: Yeah, I would say
we're about at the halfway point

542
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,990
as as depressing as that might
sound right in this whole

543
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:54,360
pandemic. And with everything
else going on, we're still we

544
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,800
still get, I would say at least
by maybe, maybe the summer.

545
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,470
We'll we'll start to see normal
again. And we can start catching

546
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,250
up on things.

547
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,990
Jamie Duncan: Yeah, I hope to be
able to visit my friends in

548
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,560
September.

549
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,150
John Osborne: I hadn't even
thought test today.

550
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,350
But yeah,

551
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,070
Jamie Duncan: yeah, it's just
and I wish we had some sort of

552
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,680
piffy thing. I wish that we
could do some headspace

553
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,420
meditation. Yeah, no, I'm

554
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,050
Tariq Islam: not about that. It
is it a lot of that stuff that

555
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:35,010
we've been doing over the last
year has felt a little forced.

556
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,000
You know, you kind of do it
because everyone else is doing

557
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,970
it. But sometimes you just want
to throw your hands up.

558
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,130
John Osborne: Were there
anything, anything you guys did

559
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,080
over the pandemic to help you
clear your head,

560
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,260
Jamie Duncan: I've tried 1000
things none of them have stuck.

561
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,620
Tariq Islam: I started working I
started exercising outside,

562
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,500
especially after a cold, which
sounds kind of crazy. But it's

563
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,730
been a pretty nice release. For
me, at least it's you know, a

564
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,520
bit of a shock to the system to
go outside when it's, you know,

565
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:12,180
2530 degrees and and be
physically active. But that

566
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:17,220
that's it's been refreshing,
right? And it works for me. But

567
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,480
it's not for everybody.

568
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,970
Jamie Duncan: The thing that
that I've kind of realized and I

569
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,610
told this to my wife and she
looked at me like Oh, you're

570
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:28,230
just now figuring this out the
another line from a movie in

571
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:32,340
frozen too. And we all have kids
I know that you too have watched

572
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,400
frozen to 1000 times but there's
no doubt in my mind completing

573
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,450
the fifth on that. arc if you
haven't watched frozen two you

574
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:44,280
have to tomorrow. Olaf the
snowman like crazy stuff is

575
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,920
happening in the front of the
movie. And all these little kids

576
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,860
are sticking icicles in Olaf.
And they're making him look

577
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,760
funny and it's just a laugh line
and they asked him if he's okay

578
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,940
and he looks around he's like
you know, we're controlling when

579
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,670
things are out of control we do
what we can to do something and

580
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:03,060
control I don't remember the
exact line but I like Tarik is

581
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:09,510
going outside and working out
like rocky in the I've gone like

582
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:13,170
I'm trying to turn my my
backyard workshop into like the

583
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:17,010
new Yankee workshop. Like so
I've got like I'm doing all

584
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,610
these ridiculous projects that
are way over my head and ability

585
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:24,510
or scope. Grab what you can, I
guess is the only thought that I

586
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,570
have. Grab onto something that
gives you a little bit of a

587
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:32,370
smile, like tark targets working
out. me making things out of

588
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,910
wood that isn't what you're
maybe slowing down a little bit

589
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:40,590
by looking at something else and
making that important to you.

590
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,320
Tariq Islam: Yeah, that's that's
actually I think you just keyed

591
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,070
in on something right there
right now it's not so much

592
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,960
distracting but it's it's it's a
shift in focus. Right so you're

593
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,640
not feeling like you're always
just constantly driving towards

594
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:59,970
you know that that competitive
like I need to know more tech

595
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,780
Then the next person. And and it
gives, it gives you a sense of

596
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,100
control that I think everybody
kind of lost last year when the

597
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:16,740
pandemic hit. And I think that's
really important. You know, and

598
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:23,760
that's also I think, why we did
this episode like this, right,

599
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,090
because I think as much as we
would love to regale you with

600
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,650
the intricacies of ci CD
infrastructure, and all the

601
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:36,720
permutations they're in, I think
it's, and we needed to pause

602
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:40,140
right, and communicate that it's
okay to do that. And shift focus

603
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,630
a little bit acknowledge the
pains that we've experienced

604
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:49,680
over the last year. And, and,
you know, be real about, you

605
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,860
know, put a little bit of
humanity in, in, in even a tech

606
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,520
podcast, I

607
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:53,970
Unknown: guess.

608
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:56,279
Jamie Duncan: I think that's a
great spot to kind of close it

609
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,279
up on it's john, any closing
thoughts, words of wisdom?

610
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,150
John Osborne: Now, what

611
00:36:00,149 --> 00:36:02,249
Jamie Duncan: do you what do you
do to stay sane, john,

612
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,040
Tariq Islam: he was oddly
started there.

613
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,650
John Osborne: I watched a lot of
the office. There you go. I

614
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:13,440
started working out a couple
months ago. And during the

615
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,600
pandemic, towards the end, I
started taking walks at night,

616
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,220
which was really helpful,
because I wasn't really having

617
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,340
enough time to work out. And
then at the start of the

618
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,910
pandemic, I was trying to keep
the same speed. So it started, I

619
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,370
was sleeping like three or four
hours a night and just totally

620
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:34,770
destroyed. My ability to focus
on that stuff. So one thing I

621
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:38,520
realized is like, you know, if,
if 2020 if there's ever a 2020,

622
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,300
again, hope there isn't, you
know, I'm gonna prioritize

623
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,350
getting a certain amount of rest
from from the start and just try

624
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:49,440
to live that every day because I
totally just tried to keep the

625
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,850
same pace and just really,
everything kind of fell apart

626
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,300
after about two months of four
hours of sleep. So I think sleep

627
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,880
is just one of those things
where you kind of take it for

628
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,780
granted, but it's, you know,
you're paying it somewhere,

629
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,000
right? You can your neck, if
your body wants eight hours, you

630
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,780
can't just get for continuously
and expect things to be okay,

631
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,440
because they won't

632
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,870
Jamie Duncan: get you're gonna
pay up at some point. Yes. Or

633
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,810
someone is, yeah, maybe your
kids and maybe your wife and

634
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:19,860
maybe the guy, you know, not
wearing a mask at the gas

635
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,740
station. Exactly. Which may have
happened to me once about a

636
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,160
month ago.

637
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,580
John Osborne: You're putting it
on a credit card, and some you

638
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,080
know, there's interest on that.
So,

639
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,060
Jamie Duncan: all right,
everyone, well, we appreciate

640
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,450
it. Next time, and we're gonna
try one of the things that we

641
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:39,660
want to control is getting back
on a good schedule in 2021. And

642
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,960
we'll pick up ci CD next time,
and until then, take a deep

643
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,770
breath. The work will be there.
When you after you've calmed

644
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:50,340
down and enjoyed something
that's right.

645
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:50,850
Tariq Islam: And mask

646
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:54,360
Jamie Duncan: up. Yeah, and wear
your damn mask or I'm gonna yell

647
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:54,600
at you.

648
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,820
John Osborne: Or a cover is
supposed to cover your nose.

649
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,080
Okay. Yeah.

650
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,679
Tariq Islam: My God seriously.

651
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,260
John Osborne: covers you.

652
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,540
Jamie Duncan: Thanks a lot,
everyone.
