Thanks for joining us on The K Files. Each week we take on a different topic in the Kubernetes community and the IT industry. Depending on the week we may find ourselves knee-deep in kernel headers, magic quadrants, or startup pitch decks. Our goal is to close each file with a sense of completeness and satisfaction for us and for anyone listening.
