Episode 11 is the beginning of a 5-6 episode series about CI/CD in the modern Kubernetes ecosystem. In the first episode, we lay out our ground rules and begin the discussions by focusing on the CI/CD backbone tools available in 2020. We break them into different categories and compare capabilities and experiences.

We didn't cover [Kubecon Virtual 2020](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/), and we'll likely not cover [re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) for the next episode. :)
