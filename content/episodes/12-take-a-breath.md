We take a short diversion from our planned CI/CD series to try and identify a few of the countless stresses that bombarded all of us in 2020. We try to figure out what, if anything, we can do about it and what's worked from our attempts to stay sane and productive during this generational turmoil.

Not much tech, but we hope you'll still get something from it.
