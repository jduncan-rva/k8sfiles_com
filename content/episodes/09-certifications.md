We dig down into how the CKA Kubernetes certification looks and feels, and what value certifications bring our industry (hint: it's a lot on balance). To prepare for this episode John took 4 exams in 17 days while Jamie took 2 and has another scheduled for early November 2020. So this isn't abstract, this is real life that we've recently lived.
